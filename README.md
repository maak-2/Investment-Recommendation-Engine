**Hybrid Python Investment Recommendation Engine Using Financial Behaviour Survey Data**
---

## 📝 Short Description
A Python-powered investment recommendation system that analyses investor profiles and provides personalised,
explainable investment suggestions. Built using a real-world financial behaviour survey dataset,
the engine uses hybrid logic—combining data-driven statistical profiling with rule-based risk adjustments—and offers both CLI and Streamlit interfaces.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project delivers an end-to-end **Investment Recommendation Engine** developed in Python. Using a dataset of investor behaviours and financial preferences,
the system evaluates user inputs such as investment duration, expected returns, and risk appetite to generate **data-backed investment recommendations**.

The recommendation engine integrates:

- **Segment-based statistical analysis** (mean preference scoring)
- **Rule-based risk modelling**
- **Explanation generation** via investor motivation fields
- **Two user interfaces:**
  - Command-Line Interface (CLI)
  - Streamlit Web Application

The goal is to create a transparent, user-friendly tool that mirrors real-world financial advisory logic using data science techniques.
